A young Goombarius, a Goomba wearing a red hat is searching for love. It's up to a contemplating Mario and a wide cast of friends to help Goombarius get a girl. Welcome to the most bizarre Paper Mario hack yet featuring remixed levels and various content from previous PM64 hacks.

"𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁'𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗶𝗴 𝗱𝗲𝗮𝗹?"

This hack originally started out as a joke I amde with my friends where I'd make Goombario rate each enemy depending on how he feels about their looks or personality. It then turned into me recolouring areas and increasing enemy stats. Eventually I went so far into it to give the game its own storyline and making it a goal to change every line of dialogue in the game. Naturally as I'm working at this mostly solo, that's a truly daunting task.

The game has also received an entirely new OST featuring songs from some of my favourite games such as Mega Man, Ninja Gaiden and Kirby. As I learned Star Rod more, I began to add new features from other hacks like Master Quest and TTYD64 such as Superguarding, custom badges, enemies and more.

If anybody more knowledgeable would like to add their own badges into the game, feel free to help me out with that.
I'll also take dialogue suggestions and bug testing as well. Anything to help progress the hack along a little quicker.
Anyways you can download the mod here, or click the release page for the most recent version.
